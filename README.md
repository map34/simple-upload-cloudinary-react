# Simple Upload
Simple file upload using React. Code is an updated version from [Damonbauer's react-cloudinary](https://github.com/damonbauer/react-cloudinary.git). Changes include code updates to using [React-Dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org/), loading message during POST request for Cloudinary, and local enviornment variable setup to prevent sharing Cloudinary API.
